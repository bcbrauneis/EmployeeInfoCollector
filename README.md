# UT Bootcamp Employee Data Display

## Objective

The objective of this project was to take pregiven code, and add features in JavaScript to increase the user accessability. I needed to add a peomts pop up that collects intell like a first name, a last name and a salary. Then have it store and display that information in presedignated areas. Then in the enternal console have it calculate the average salary of all the works and selectv a ranomd name to be selected as a winner.

## Explination

The first thing i worked out was how to prompt a user to give info and store it speratly in the same array. Removing the possibility of the names being brought in in the process. After that a function to calculate the average of all the salaries inputted. Then display is in a console log. 

After that another function was needed to to select a random name, and only the name no numbers. Then console log it.

Then after that we were told not to alter the starting code given. But i needed to channge a few variables and event triggers for everything to dipslay properly. 99% of the orginal code is still there.
